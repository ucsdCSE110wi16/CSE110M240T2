    <lesson title='Angles'>
        <body>Angle: When two rays begin at a common point, a geometric figure is formed. The space between such rays, measured in degrees (°), is the angle.\n\ta. Zero Angle: Such an angle is formed when two rays completely overlap with each other (0°).\n\tb. Right Angle: This angle is formed when the space between two rays is 90°. It is similar to the corner of a square. It is usually represented by a small square between the lines.\n\tc. Straight Angle: This angle is formed when the space between two rays is 180°. This means that the rays start at a common point, but extend in directly opposite directions.\n\td. Full Angle: If we continue to increase the space between two rays that start at a common point, there will come a time when they overlap with each other. When this happens, the angle is 360°.\n\te. Acute Angle: It is an angle that is more than 0° but less than 90°.\n\tf. Obtuse Angle: It is an angle that is more than 90° but less than 180°.\n\tg. Reflex Angle: It is an angle that is more than 180° but less than 360°.\n

        <body>Parallel Lines: Two lines that never intersect are known as parallel lines.\n
            a. When a line intersects two other lines (which are parallel), the angles formed are identical on either of the parallel lines. For example: If there are two parallel lines, and a third one intersects both of them, a pair of vertical angles formed on the first line will be identical to the corresponding pair of vertical angles formed on the second line.\n

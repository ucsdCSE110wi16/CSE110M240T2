Lines, line segments, rays are all collections of points.\nPlane: A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far. It is the two-dimensional analogue of a point (zero dimensions), a line (one dimension).\nCollinear Points: Points are collinear if they lie on the same line.\nCoplanar Points: Points are coplanar if they both lie on the same plane.\n</body>

    <lesson title='Angles'>
        <body>Angle: When two rays begin at a common point, a geometric figure is formed. The space between such rays, measured in degrees (°), is the angle.\n
            a. Zero Angle: Such an angle is formed when two rays completely overlap with each other (0°).\n
            b. Right Angle: This angle is formed when the space between two rays is 90°. It is similar to the corner of a square. It is usually represented by a small square between the lines.\n
            c. Straight Angle: This angle is formed when the space between two rays is 180°. This means that the rays start at a common point, but extend in directly opposite directions.\n
            d. Full Angle: If we continue to increase the space between two rays that start at a common point, there will come a time when they overlap with each other. When this happens, the angle is 360°.\n
            e. Acute Angle: It is an angle that is more than 0° but less than 90°.\n
            f. Obtuse Angle: It is an angle that is more than 90° but less than 180°.\n
            g. Reflex Angle: It is an angle that is more than 180° but less than 360°.\n

    <lesson title='Parallel Lines'>
        <body>Parallel Lines: Two lines that never intersect are known as parallel lines.\n
            a. When a line intersects two other lines (which are parallel), the angles formed are identical on either of the parallel lines. For example: If there are two parallel lines, and a third one intersects both of them, a pair of vertical angles formed on the first line will be identical to the corresponding pair of vertical angles formed on the second line.\n

            <body>Point: A point is a geometric object that signifies a location, but has no size in itself. Lines, line segments, rays are all collections of points.\nPlane: A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far. It is the two-dimensional analogue of a point (zero dimensions), a line (one dimension).\nCollinear Points: Points are collinear if they lie on the same line.\nCoplanar Points: Points are coplanar if they both lie on the same plane.\n</body>

            <body>Quad" means "four" and "lateral" means "line." A quadrilateral is literally a shape with four sides (lines) and four angles that add to 360 degrees.\nConcave Quadrilaterals: Has one interior angle larger than 180 degrees.\nConvex Quadrilaterals: All angles are less than 180 degrees.\nTrapezoid: A quadrilateral with exactly 2 sides parallel to each other.\nParallelogram: A quadrilateral with 2 pairs of parallel sides.\nRectangle: A parallelogram with 4 right angles.\nRhombus: A parallelogram where all 4 sides are equivalent.\nSquare: A rectangular rhombus. In other words, a parallelogramwith 4 right angles are 4 equivalent sides.\n</body>

    	<lesson title='Circle Basics'>
		<body>Pi : Pi is a fundamental constant when determining many basic properties of circles. It represents the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter.\nRadius : The radius of a circle is the distance between the center of the circle to the edge of the circle.\nDiameter : The diameter of a circle is the length of the line segment that divides the circle in half into two semi-circles.\nCircumference : The circumference of a circle is the linear distance around its edge. The circumference is essentially the perimeter of the circle.\n</body>

	<lesson title='Standard Equation of a Circle'>
		<body>General format of circle equation: ax^2 + by^2 + cx + dy + e = 0\nCenter-radius form of circle:  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\nThe center of the circle is easily found using this equation : (h,k)\nThe radius of the circle is also easily found : (r).\n</body>
	</lesson>
	<lesson title='Arcs'>
		<body>An arc is simply a closed segment of the edge of a circle.\nMinor arc : an arc with an angle less than 180 degrees.\nMajor arc: an arc with an angle greater than 180 degrees.\nArc Measure: arc measure is the angle of the central angle of an arc. In other words, the angle formed between the two radii that connect to the ends of the arc represents the arc measure.\nLength of an arc: The equation to find the length of an arc is equal to (theta)r, where (theta) is the angle the arc subtends and r is the radius of the circle.\n</body>
